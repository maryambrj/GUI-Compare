# GUI-Compare
Compare potential GUI Libraries/options for SEE-Insight interface.  This is a list of potential GUI interfaces we are looking at to interface with the SEE-Insight software.  Folders will be created in this repository for testing of each option.  Some features we are looking for in our GUI include the following:

- Webbased option (so we can run the GUI as a server)
- Full mouse interactions with images (so we can build a paint program)
- Simple install (one command or one-click install)
- Multi-platform
